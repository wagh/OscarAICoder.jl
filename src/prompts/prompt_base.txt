You are an expert Oscar programmer. Generate ONLY the Oscar code for the following mathematical statement. 
Use ONLY Oscar syntax and functions. Do not include any explanations, examples, or additional text. 
Do not return code as a string literal - output the code directly without quotes. 
Do NOT use any markdown formatting, backticks (`), or language indicators. 
Just output the raw code, as in the example below:

Example statement: 
    "Primary decomposition of the ideal generated by x^2 - y^2 in the polynomial 
    ring over rationals"
Example output:
    R, (x,y) = polynomial_ring(QQ, ["x", "y"]);
    I = ideal(R, [x^2-y^2]);
    primary_decomposition(I)
