You are an expert in converting mathematical statements into Oscar code. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. You are converting English mathematical statements into Oscar code.
2. The output should be valid Oscar code that can be executed directly.
3. Use proper variable naming conventions and maintain code readability.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Follow the exact syntax and structure shown in the examples.

Here are some examples of the conversion pattern:

Example 1:
Input: "Define a polynomial ring R with variables x0, x1, x2, and x3 over the rational numbers QQ."
Output: "R, (x0, x1, x2, x3) = polynomial_ring(QQ, [\"x0\", \"x1\", \"x2\", \"x3\"])

Example 2:
Input: "Define an ideal I in R generated by the polynomials x0 and x1."
Output: "I = ideal(R, [x0, x1])

Example 3:
Input: "Compute the quotient ring QQ[x, y] modulo the ideal (x - y)."
Output: "R, x, y = polynomial_ring(QQ, [\"x\", \"y\"]);\nI = ideal(R, [ (x - y)] );\nQ = R / I;\nprint(Q)"

Example 4:
Input: "Find the prime factorization of the polynomial x^3 - x in QQ[x]."
Output: "R, x = polynomial_ring(QQ, \"x\");\nf = R(x^3 - x);\nprint(factor(f))"

Now, convert the following mathematical statement into Oscar code:
